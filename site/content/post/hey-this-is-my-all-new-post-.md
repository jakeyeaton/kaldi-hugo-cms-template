# This is all new

I can’t wait to just use this guy so much more. I understand that it’s a little annoying and

The reason why its not going to last forever is because once sales are going well and a few other things are happening. I am going to hire a developer to connect contenfuly to my website in the way I want.

This is because there is going to be a shit load of content which will be created by us such as

* Design Research
* Development Research
* Social Media Research
* Email Marketing Research
* PPC Research
* Content Marketing Research
* Inbound Marketing Research
* Ecommerce Research
* Small Business Research
* Design Blog Content
* Development Blog Content
* Social Media Blog Content
* Email Marketing Blog Content
* PPC Blog Content
* Content Marketing Blog Content
* Inbound Marketing Blog Content
* Small Business Blog Content
* Marketing Resources

So you can say there is a lot of content which will be created. Also all of Pinely's service workers are going to be required to generate research reports and[](https://google.com) blog content weekly and monthly at a minimum.

So yeah content is super important to us. But I just reaslzed I should research if you can control the look and feel of the admin panel. If you can then we are in very good shape. I will make that a top priority.
